# Compression Strength Predictor for Concrete Mixtures

## Welcome
The main objective of this Capstone Project is to create a Model for Skin Cancer detection and then create the environment for deployment.

## Why Skin Cancer Detection?
Skin cancer emerges as one of the rapidly proliferating diseases worldwide. It involves the uncontrolled development of abnormal skin cells. Detecting and diagnosing the disease early are crucial steps in identifying potential cancer therapies
[1].
The present challenge associated with manual identification performed by skilled medical professionals is its susceptibility to variation based on experience in the field. Even in the case of experts, there is a potential for mislabeling. For instance, the accuracy in diagnosing basal cell carcinoma (BCC), indicated by the higher positive predictive value (PPV), stands at 72.7% [2].
The application of AI models has proven to be an invaluable tool for skin cancer identification. This technology enables individuals with smartphones to achieve accuracies comparable to or surpassing those of trained experts [3].
